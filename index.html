  <h1>How to take care of your cat?</h1>
  <p>There’s nothing cuter than watching a cat chase a patch of light, using their paws to knead as if they’re baking
    bread, or climbing into everything and anything. That’s why the internet is practically made of cats, with millions
    of videos to show us just how adorable and funny these felines can be.</p>

  <p>But if you’re planning on adopting a cat or kitten, <b>what’s the best way of caring for your fluffy friend?</b>
  </p>
  <h2>1. Provide plenty of human companionship</h2>
  <p>Cats need play sessions to engage their minds and exercise their bodies. We all know cats enjoy a good

    Here are some other fun ways to play with your cat:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Play hide-and-seek</li>
    <li>Have a singing contest</li>
    <li>Teach it a trick</li>
    <li>Give it an empty box</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Provide regular, suitable meals with a constant supply of fresh water</h2>
  <p>The number of meals a cat eats per day depends completely on the family schedule. Cats should eat <b>at least two
      meals each day</b>, about 12 hours apart.
    Canned food is more beneficial than dry food for several reasons. But, it is also more expensive and messier to
    feed.</p>

  <h2>3. Provide the cat with outdoor access or be prepared to empty and clean a litter tray on a daily basis</h2>
  <p>The best way to clean a litter box is to dump the entire box and soak it in hot water for a few minutes <b>at
      least once a week</b>.
    There are different types of fillers for litter tray: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wood fillers</li>
    <li>Fillers based on minerals</li>
    <li>Silica gel fillers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Groom it regularly. Longhaired cats require daily grooming</h2>
  <p>The process of grooming your cat should be fun for you and for them. Try to schedule a grooming session for a
    time when your cat is already calm and sleepy,
    such as after dinner. You should also be in a good mood — your cat will notice if you’re grumpy or stressed during
    the grooming session, and this can stress
    them out in turn.</p>

  <h2>5. Vaccinate against the major feline diseases regularly</h2>
  <p>Vaccinations are a critical part of preventive health care for your cat. Even indoor cats can be exposed to
    serious and potentially fatal diseases because many of the diseases that fit within the normal vaccine schedule
    are airborne.
    An open window is all it takes to expose your pet.With a series of cat vaccinations, you can ensure that your cat
    is protected and safe, no matter what the future holds.</p>

  <h2>6. Provide treatment for fleas</h2>

  </ul>
  <h2>7. Take the cat to the vet when it shows any sign of illness</h2>
